# MoosePress

The core of a small, bespoke CMS for the work that I do.

## Goals

- No frills, minimalist code base.
- Isolation and encapsulation of all components.
- Abstraction and automation of everything but the content itself.
- Easy to use content templates that pass themselves to a page wrapper.
- Transparent switching between database and flatfile data sources.
- Easy to expand core.
- Custom logic relegated to templates.
