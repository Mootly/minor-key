This is a destination folder for scripts transpiled from TypeScript into ES6 / ECMAScript 2015.

Edits should be done in the /_src/ts/ folder and transpiled from there.

Changes made here will get overwritten next time the code is transpiled.

ES6 should **not** be used if the site has to support Internet Explorer.
